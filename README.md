# CzechGeneUse

**CzechGeneUse** is a grassroots platform aiming to support Czech scientists through microtransactions, transparent science communication, and community engagement.

## 🎯 Vision

The goal of CzechGeneUse is to:
- Enable Czech scientists, PhD students, and young researchers to present their research to the public in an accessible way.
- Allow the public to support their favorite scientific minds through small donations (e.g., "Buy a coffee", "Pay for wellness", etc.).
- Create a space for science outreach, visibility, and mutual connection between researchers and society.
- Build a national scientific community with fair and transparent support systems.
