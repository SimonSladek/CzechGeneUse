# CzechGenius

**CzechGenius** is an independent Czech platform designed to support scientists, creators, and socially valuable projects through microtransactions, transparent storytelling, and direct public support.

---

## 🎯 Vision

The mission of CzechGenius is to:

- Empower Czech scientists, students, and creators to present their work to the public in a personal and accessible way.
- Enable the public to support inspiring projects with small donations (e.g., "Buy a coffee", "Pay for lunch", "Support a wellness day").
- Build a transparent environment where contributors see exactly **who they support** and **how they help**.
- Create a grassroots movement that reconnects society with those who make meaningful contributions—without intermediaries.

## 🧪 MVP Features

The initial version of the platform will include:

- Public creator profiles (photo, bio, project description)
- Donation options with creative labels ("Buy coffee", "Buy lunch", etc.)
- Public leaderboard of top supporters (individuals and companies)
- About Me page introducing the creator of CzechGenius and their vision
- Basic backend system to track contributions (mock/test version only)

- **The Czech community** – Designed for local context, transparency, and language.
- **Science + Creativity** – Open to scientists, artists, educators, and innovators.
- **100% ownership** – Built from scratch using free and open-source tools by one passionate founder.
- **Low fees** – The platform will take only ~10% to reinvest into its development and infrastructure.
